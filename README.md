# GameEng
Experimental game engine framework project with implementation tests

Developed with VS 2013.
Other devs have reported that later versions of VS complain about ambiguous versions of abs() calls.  Have not yet fixed that issue.

Current code is compressed into a .zip file and is too large with all of the graphics files to upload.  I'll organize this later.
