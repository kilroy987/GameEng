# GameEng
Experimental game engine framework project with implementation tests

Developed with VS 2013.
Other devs have reported that later versions of VS complain about ambiguous versions of abs() calls.  Have not yet fixed that issue.

Only the form project (GameengDev) has the graphics files necessary to execute.  To provide the files for the FullScreenTest project, just copy all the graphics files from the GameEndDev project to the corresponding FullScreenText folder.  I removed them because the file was too big to upload otherwise (max 25 MB)
